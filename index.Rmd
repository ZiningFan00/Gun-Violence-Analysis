# Introduction

The United States is one of the countries in which firearm possession is legal. In the US, the legal basis for gun possession is enshrined in the Second Amendment of the Constitution. People are always curious to know how the gun is controlled and what influence gun would bring to our life. In this project, we would like to use gun violence data as an entry point, trying to answer the following questions:  

1) Which state has the largest number of casualties caused by gun violence? When and where did these incidents happen? Which kind of gun violence is the most common?  
2) Is there any relationship between gun violence and gun sales?  
3) Is there any relationship between gun violence and GDP?  
4) Is there any spatial pattern of the gun violence incidents?
